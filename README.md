# 64-bit Operating System Kernel From Scratch


This guide walks you through the process of building and emulating a 64-bit operating system kernel from scratch. It provides detailed steps for setting up the environment, building the kernel, and emulating it on your local machine. 

## Prerequisites

 - A text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for creating our build-environment.
 - [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) for emulating our operating system.
   - Remember to add Qemu to the path so that you can access it from your command-line. ([Windows instructions here](https://dev.to/whaleshark271/using-qemu-on-windows-10-home-edition-4062))

## Setup

Build an image for our build-environment:
 - `docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv`

## Build

Enter build environment:
 - Linux or MacOS: `docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (CMD): `docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (PowerShell): `docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv`


Build for x86 :
 - `make build-x86_64`
 - If you are using Qemu, please close it before running this command to prevent errors.

To leave the build environment, enter `exit`.

## Emulate

You can emulate your operating system using [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/): (Don't forget to [add qemu to your path](https://dev.to/whaleshark271/using-qemu-on-windows-10-home-edition-4062#:~:text=2.-,Add%20Qemu%20path%20to%20environment%20variables%20settings,-Copy%20the%20Qemu)!)

 - `qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso`


## Cleanup

Remove the build-evironment image:
 - `docker rmi myos-buildenv -f`
